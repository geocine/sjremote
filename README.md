A very simple remote for **[SJCam](http://www.sjcam.com/)** on Android via  wifi. This application supports *Android 2.2.x* **Froyo** and up.

This application does not have a video preview, this is just a remote control. It only contains the following features: 
- video mode
- photo mode
- take picture
- start record video
- stop record video

Because the application is very lightweight and does not contain unneeded features , it is fast on very slow devices.

This has only been tested on **SJ5000 Wifi**
